SHDLC Protocol
==============

SHDLC (Sensirion High-Level Data Link Control) is a byte-oriented master-slave
communication protocol based on `ISO HDLC`_. It is used to control some of
Sensirion's devices (for example mass flow controllers). The detailed protocol
documentation is not publicly available (yet). If you need it, please contact
our `customer support`_.
