# Python Driver for Sensirion SHDLC Devices

This repository contains the base driver for Sensirion SHDLC devices as a Python
package. For details, please read the package description in
[README.rst](README.rst).

## Work In Progress!

This driver is currently in development and not usable yet! Also the device-
specific drivers are not available yet, they will follow soon.

## Development

We develop and test this driver using our company internal tools (version
control, continuous integration, code review etc.) and automatically
synchronize the `master` branch with GitHub. But this doesn't mean that we
don't respond to issues or don't accept pull requests on GitHub. In fact,
you're very welcome to open issues or create pull requests :)

## Usage

See package description in [README.rst](README.rst) and user manual at
